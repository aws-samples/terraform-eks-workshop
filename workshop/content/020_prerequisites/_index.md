# This workshop has now been replaced by a [newer version](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/afee4679-89af-408b-8108-44f5b1065cc7)



### Getting Started


To start the workshop, follow the following instructions ...


* [attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)](020_prerequisites/aws_event.html) 
  
  or

* [running the workshop on your own (in your own account)](020_prerequisites/self_paced.html)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Create a Workspace**](020_prerequisites/workspace.html)
