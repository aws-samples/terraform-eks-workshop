![tf-state](/images/andyt/cloud9-ide.jpg)

From which we will now build out the rest of the required infrastructure.


{{% notice info %}}
Despite being in a public subnet Cloud9 IDE's associated security group allows no incoming connections of any type.
The only way to connect to the IDE environment is via an athenticated user using the AWS console.
