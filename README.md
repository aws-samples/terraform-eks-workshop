# workshop-sample

This project allows you to scaffold a workshop using a AWS-styled Hugo theme similar to those available at [cdkworkshop.com](https://cdkworkshop.com/), [eksworkshop.com](https://eksworkshop.com/), or [ecsworkshop.com](https://ecsworkshop.com/).

## Requirements

1. [Clone this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2. [Install Hugo locally](https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/).

## Create your first chapter page

Chapters are pages that contain other child pages. It has a special layout style and usually just contains a _brief abstract_ of the section.

```markdown
Discover what this template is all about and the core concepts behind it.
```

This template provides archetypes to create skeletons for your workshop. Begin by creating your first chapter page with the following command

```bash
hugo new --kind chapter intro/_index.en.md
```

By opening the given file, you should see the property `chapter=true` on top, meaning this page is a _chapter_.

By default all chapters and pages are created as a draft. If you want to render these pages, remove the property `draft = true` from the metadata.

## Create your first content pages

Then, create content pages inside the previously created chapter. Here are two ways to create content in the chapter:

```bash
hugo new intro/first-content.en.md
hugo new intro/second-content/_index.en.md
```

Feel free to edit thoses files by adding some sample content and replacing the `title` value in the beginning of the files. 

## Launching the website locally

Launch by using the following command:

```bash
hugo serve
```

Go to `http://localhost:1313`

You should notice three things:

1. You have a left-side **Intro** menu, containing two submenus with names equal to the `title` properties in the previously created files.
2. The home page explains how to customize it by following the instructions.
3. When you run `hugo serve`, when the contents of the files change, the page automatically refreshes with the changes. Neat!

Alternatively, you can run the following command in a terminal window to tell Hugo to automatically rebuild whenever a file is changed. This can be helpful when rapidly iterating over content changes.

```bash
hugo serve -D
```
